# Basic_HTML



This file is made of pure HTML file.
Just for the understandings of how HTML Tags and HTML Attributes work.

The Tags which are included in this file are:
Paragraph Tag, Break Tag, Heading Tag, (Bold, Italics and Underline) Tag
Image Tag, Division Tag, Title Tag and Anchor Tag

The Attributes which are included in this file are:
src, alt, width and height in image tag
herf in anchor tag
and I used little bit of CSS with style tag
